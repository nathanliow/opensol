Welcome! OpenSOL is a visual programming platform designed to democratize Solana blockchain development through a no-code interface. It combines the accessibility of visual programming with the power of blockchain technology.



## Overview of OpenSOL
### Why OpenSOL? #
1. Lack of open source code
2. Make solana development easier with a no code solution
3. Incentivize open source code contributions by allowing community to contribute custom functions (merge requests to Solana101 Repo)
4. Financially award top contributors and protocol

### Incentivization Model: #
1. 0.10 SOL to contribute custom block
2. 0.01 SOL to vote against a custom block 
3. 0.01 SOL to vote for a custom block
4. 5% of all contributions go to protocol
5. 5% of all contributions go to top contributors at the end of a set amount of time

### Run OpenSOL
OpenSOL consists of a frontend and a backend. However, (for now) only the frontend runs.

```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```
