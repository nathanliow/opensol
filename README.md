## OpenSOL ##

# Things we're tackling: #
1. Lack of open source code
2. Make solana development easier with a no code solution
3. Incentivize open source code contributions by allowing community to contribute custom functions (merge requests to Solana101 Repo)
4. Financially award top contributors and protocol
5. Open source code can be a means for education for everyone (devs/students/clubs)

# Incentivization Model: #
1. 0.10 SOL to contribute custom block
2. 0.01 SOL to vote against a custom block 
3. 0.01 SOL to vote for a custom block
4. 5% of all contributions go to protocol
5. 5% of all contributions go to top contributors at the end of a set amount of time
